The price action of cryptocurrencies is sensitive to twitter posts from key accounts, such as Exchanges, News,
 Project Developers and notable influencers such as Elon Musk.

Price action do react in real-time in response to tweets from these accounts. This is due to trading sentiment and the 
presence of bots.

My app allows users to subscribe to developed twitter data feeds and trade automatically upon news release.

The features I have built are;
1. Email notification and immediate coin buy when Coinbase annouces new coin listing.
2. Email notification and immediate coin buy when Elon Musk tweets Doge.

With the demo app, users can choose to subscribe to email notifications, and connect their FTX exchange API keys.
